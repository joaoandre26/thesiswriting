A conventional gas actuation system, which is fitted on the gas pipeline going to the pressure regulator, sends a signal to the unit installed inside of the vehicle that indicates the pressure, normally through four LEDs. A well-tested design is presented in this paper, which gives an accurate and precise measurement of gas pressure in NGVs (Natural Gas Vehicles) using a non-contact sensor mechanism. The final product has an accuracy of 2.0\% having a gauge reading of 6000 psi, tested and verified at 4500 psi.},

In this study, a method is presented, which permits the contactless measurement of liquid levels in thin opaque capillaries at high pressures. The method is based on the mass dependence of the flexural resonance frequencies of a finite section of a tube. These resonance frequencies are determined from the complex electrical impedance of a slitted toroid coil exciting a magnet attached to the tube. The system has been theoretically described using a set of two Bernoulli–Euler beams, resulting in an analytical solution for the equation of motion. To validate the model, experiments have been performed on a thick-walled stainless steel capillary partly filled with mercury. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the sensitivity of the method appears to be adequate as a fluid level indicator for control purposes in industrial applications.},

  abstract = {The deployment of next-generation renewable biofuels can be enhanced by improving their compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation, storage and utilization. Propane, the bulk component of liquid petroleum gas, is an appealing target as it already has a global market. In addition, it is a gas under standard conditions, but can easily be liquefied. This allows the fuel to immediately separate from the biocatalytic process after synthesis, yet does not preclude energy-dense storage as a liquid. Here we report, for the first time, a synthetic metabolic pathway for producing renewable propane. The pathway is based on a thioesterase specific for butyryl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), which allows native fatty acid biosynthesis of the Escherichia coli host to be redirected towards a synthetic alkane pathway. Propane biosynthesis is markedly stimulated by the introduction of an electron-donating module, optimizing the balance of O2 supply and removal of native aldehyde reductases. Propane is the main component of liquid petroleum gas and has a wide variety of commercial applications. Here, the authors engineer a synthetic metabolic pathway in E. coli, and demonstrate for the first time the renewable production of propane.},

A millimeter-wave Doppler sensor is developed to “see” (i.e., sense) through a target container and measure the liquid level on the basis of the absorption of millimeter waves in liquid. One of the challenges is to accurately measure liquid level (within sub-millimeter error) despite the inherently large beam diameter of the millimeter wave due to diffraction. A piezoelectric vibrator enables accurate measurement by reflecting a limited portion of the spread beam and modulating it in frequency to distinguish it from the other portion of the beam. A prototype measurement system is fabricated and evaluated. The feasibility of our proposed method for clearly detecting an air-liquid interface concealed in an opaque container is confirmed experimentally. The nonlinearity error of the measured liquid level is within ±0.5 mm .},

However, many times it happens that because of the rush or due to the shortage of the cylinder, there is a delay in providing the gas cylinder. The main reason behind this is the delay in informing to the gas provider or we inform the gas provider at the last moment when the gas is empty. This project also detects the leakage of gas from LPG cylinder using gas sensor which is very sensitive to detect presence of LPG (composed of mostly butane and propane).

Leakage of this gas raises the risk of building fire, suffocation or an explosion. The mentioned problem can be solved with the development of reliable techniques to detect gas leakage. As soon as gas leakage will be detected, user will be notified via SMS and call so that he/she can turn off gas valve from anywhere in his work place. The issue of flame and fire at kitchen can be monitored with the help of fire sensor. The buzzer starts beeping whenever fire is detected. In addition to these, it is often found that a person forgets to book gas cylinder due to his/her busy schedule. The main aim of this paper is to design an IOT based Smart Gas Management System that will be able to detect gas leakage and fire. With the help of load sensor, automatic booking of a gas cylinder is also facilitated. Notification is sent to the booking agency to book a gas cylinder whenever load cell detects that the weight of gas cylinder has reached below a threshold value. At the same time, user will be notified about gas cylinder going empty.},

  abstract = {Fluid level detection for a sealed and pressurized mobile container is very useful for the provider to schedule the delivery of a new one before it runs out of the liquid. This study suggested using the frequencies of tone generated by knocking on the outside surface of the container to detect the liquid level inside. A detailed model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory has been proposed to study the feasibility of this method for a cylinder with complicated but practical structure. Household gas cylinders were used to validate the proposed model and the results show that experimental data agree well with the theoretical analysis. The results indicate that the proposed model can accurately explain the behavior of the vibratory frequencies under different liquid levels. An apparatus has been successfully implemented to automatically sense the near empty condition of the gas cylinder.},

  abstract = {While several methods using ultrasonic, acoustic or RF waves have been proposed to measure the liquid level of a sealed container, they all need to install a transmitter and receiver pair inside the top of the tank. In this paper, we propose a simpler method which provides continuous measurement by installing a knocking device outside the tank. The vibratory frequencies generated by the knocking action are analyzed by the fast Fourier transform and the dominant frequency component which is related to the liquid level inside the tank is acquired. Our experimental results show that relationship between the vibratory frequency generated by the knocking action and the liquid level can be described by Bernoulli-Euler beam theory. Therefore, this acquired relationship can be used to estimate the liquid level based on the spectrum generated by knocking the tank surface.},

  abstract = {We are reporting on the design, fabrication, and characterization of wideband, piezoelectric vibration microsensors. Prototypes were fabricated in a commercial foundry process. The entire thickness of the handle wafer was employed to carve the proof-mass of the device, leading to high sensitivity at a reduced chip area. A thin layer of aluminum nitride was used for sensing the displacements of the proof-mass. A continuous membrane was employed for the device structure in order to push undesired modes to high frequencies. Sensors with different geometries were designed and fabricated. Analytic and finite element analyses were conducted to study device response. A lump element model was developed for the piezoelectric vibration sensor and used for the noise modeling of the complete sensor system. Various performance metrics for the devices were characterized experimentally. Fabricated prototypes exhibited sensitivities as high as 350 mV/g with first resonant frequencies of more than 10 kHz. These devices are particularly suited for emerging applications in high-frequency vibration sensing.},
